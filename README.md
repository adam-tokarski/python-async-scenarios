# Python Async Scenarios 🐍🔀

I created this repository to be used to understand how async works.
Feel free to reach out to the blog post to play with it as we discuss concurrency: https://blog.guilatrova.dev/async-python-in-real-life/

## Scenarios

- [Slow API server](API/)
- [Slow Database (Postgres)](database/pgsql/)
- [Slow Database (SQLite)](database/sqlite/)
